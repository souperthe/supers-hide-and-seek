# SUPER'S HIDE & SEEK

Super's Hide & Seek (I will be referring to it as SHNS for now on), is a recreation of the Garry's Mod phenomenon "Pill-Pack Hide & Seek."

The general idea of "Pill-Pack Hide & Seek" is simple, it's a game of traditional hide & seek but the seekers are mostly evil characters from popular media, like Fredbear from TNAF or Mr. Peterson from the Hello Neighbor series.
Both seekers and hiders are put into a large map, perfect for hiding. Hiders usually have 10 seconds to hide and Seekers usually have 10 minutes to seek.
Once all hiders are dead the Seekers win, but if all Hiders are alive when times up the Hiders win.

This project aims to recreate that in a more light-weight and optimized form in Godot, with a unique spin put onto it.
