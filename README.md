# SUPER'S HIDE & SEEK

Super's Hide & Seek (I will be referring to it as SHNS for now on), is a recreation of the Garry's Mod phenomenon "Pill-Pack Hide & Seek."

The general idea of "Pill-Pack Hide & Seek" is simple, it's a game of traditional hide & seek but the seekers are mostly evil characters from popular media, like Fredbear from TNAF or Mr. Peterson from the Hello Neighbor series.

This project aims to recreate that in a more light-weight and optimized form in Godot
